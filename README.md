**Titanic-Kaggle Competition**

This project is predicting which passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic. 

I focused on binary classification via the following algorithms:
+ Logistic Regression
+ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
+ Naive Bayes (NB)
+ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
+ Random Forest (RF)

In the input folder, we have the training data as 'train.csv' and the test data as 'test.csv.' 

In the output folder, there are the individual predictions for each algorithm, summary statistics for each algorithm, and in the prediction folder we have the prediction by the best performing algorithm.

In my analysis, I found that the Random Forest algorithm performed the best.
